# Heart-Disease-prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using supervised machine learning algorithms. It analyzes medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other relevant features to determine if an individual is at risk.
Key Features:

    Dataset: UCI Heart Disease dataset containing patient medical records.

    Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier for model training and comparison.

    Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, scaling, normalization, and feature selection for optimal model performance.

    Performance Evaluation: Evaluated models using accuracy and confusion matrix to select the best-performing algorithm.

    Outcome: Random Forest Classifier showed promising results with good accuracy, making it effective for heart disease prediction.

Technologies Used:

    Programming Language: Python

    Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

    Platform: Jupyter Notebook

Objective:

To build an efficient heart disease prediction system that assists healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, enhancing medical care and reducing overall treatment costs.
